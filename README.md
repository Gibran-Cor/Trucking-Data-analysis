**Overview**

Welcome to the Trucking Data Analysis project! This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on analyzing data related to semi-trucks and their drivers. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about various aspects of trucking, including models, events, velocities, and event types. The primary goal of this project is to inspect the data and provide insights into key business questions that a trucking company would likely have.

**Business Questions**
The project addresses several business questions that are crucial for a trucking company:

**Risk Index Calculation and Forecasting:**

- Calculate and forecast a future "risk index" for drivers based on the model, event, velocity, and event type. This risk index serves as a key metric for assessing the overall risk associated with each driver.
Analysis of Risky Behaviors:

- Analyze the most risky behaviors committed by the drivers. Understanding these behaviors can help the company implement targeted interventions to improve safety.

**Identification of Risky Locations:**
- Identify locations that pose a higher risk for drivers. This information can be valuable for route planning and risk mitigation strategies.

**Identification of Risky Drivers:**
- Identify drivers with consistently high-risk profiles. This allows the company to address specific training needs or consider adjustments to driver assignments.
Analysis of Models Driven:

- Analyze the models of trucks driven by high-risk drivers. This insight can inform decisions related to maintenance, upgrades, or changes in the fleet.

**Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset obtained from Kaggle.

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are provided in this directory for data exploration, preprocessing, and analysis of risk indices, behaviors, locations, drivers, and truck models.

src: The source code for risk index calculation, forecasting, and other analyses is stored in this directory. It includes modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and risk assessment.

reports: This directory contains any reports, visualizations, or findings generated during the analysis.
